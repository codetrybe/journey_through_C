# Learning Nested Loops

In this very Peer Learning Session, we discussed what funcrions are in `C` and practically learned about `for loops` and `nested for loops`.

Contained in this directory is just one source code — [nested.c](./nested.c) — and the rest are executable files generated by `gcc nested.c -o <executable>` at different points in time, as we learned together.
And the purpose of saving them all here was to enable those who joined the live session to access the codes and remind themselves what was taught, and for those who did not attend to access and play with the source code as well.
