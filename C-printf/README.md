# The `printf()` Project
In this repository are the codes written in the series of *Peer Learning Sessions*
that held in a bid to understand and implement the `C` printf() function together.
The directories were created to show the different levels of the work we did,
the sessions were recorded and you can find the recordings on [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU10dryLOLEFM2P78uNW4FL9BJs8C4ZjR)
or on [Codetrybe Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@codetrybe), as you will
definitely find them useful.

In the part 1 of this series, we did not write any code, as it was about
revealing the secrets of *printf()*, seeing the video on **YouTube**, especially from part2, will
give you a perfect understanding of how we came about the codes in these directories.
