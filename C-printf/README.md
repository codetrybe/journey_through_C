# The `printf()` Project
In this repository are the codes written in the series of *Peer Learning Sessions*
that held in a bid to understand and implement the `C` printf() function together.
The directories were created to show the different levels the of work we did,
the sessions were recorded and you can find the recordings on
[Codetrybe Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@codetrybe), as you will
definitely find them useful
