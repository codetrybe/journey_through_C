# Extra Session on `printf()`
Here are the codes that were written in a Peer Learning session that we had on `printf()`.

It might interest you to note that:
- It was recorded but the video is not for the public. Feel free to reachout to [Topman on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tpauldike)
- The files were compiled on Windows 10 pro, using `gcc`, hence the `.exe`; you may want to recompile the source codes by yourself, if these ones do not run on your machine.
