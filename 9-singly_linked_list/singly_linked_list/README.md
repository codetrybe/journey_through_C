# Linked List Live Session
The codes were written in the live session where we discussed:
- basic linked list operations
- types of linked list and the differences

The task of having the ages of some classmates structured in a singly linked list and printed was solved, incompletely.
Seeing the video will give you an execellent understanding of these codes here.
